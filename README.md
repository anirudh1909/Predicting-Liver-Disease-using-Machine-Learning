Liver Disease Prediction 

The liver is the primary part of the body that performs many functions including the production of Bile, and the metabolism of proteins
Alcohol consumption, the use of painkillers, eating choices, and engaging in a lot of unusual activities will have the potential to impact the liver negatively.
This project will implement various machine-learning strategies for detecting liver disease.
This project will aim in comparison of different implementations.
This project will record the most efficient algorithm with the highest percentage of accuracy.

The failure of the liver may be brought on by several disorders, each of which disturbs the body's natural activities and heightens the risk of serious injury. 
Because of this sickness, a person's life might be in danger. 
When used to the research of liver disease, the objective is to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of a dataset.
CSA was selected because of its efficiency and user-friendliness, which led to the optimization of MHOAs.
Finding both the bias and the alpha is the most important step in the SVM training process.
As a result, the paper examines and gives the standard strategy for enhancing SVM lagrange values during training by using SMO. 
It has been shown that the optimization processes that make use of CSA-SVM are both simple to put into practice and effective.

Algorithms used : 

Genetic Algorithm : A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwin’s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

Multiverse Optimizer : MVO is a population-based algorithm and a meta-heuristics algorithm based on the concepts of the multi-verse theory. The MVO algorithm is a physics-inspired technique, it’s inspired by the three main concepts of the multi-verse theory: white holes, black holes, and wormholes
Firefly Algorithm :  Firefly algorithm is one of the new metaheuristic algorithms for optimization problems. The algorithm is inspired by the flashing behaviour of fireflies. In the algorithm, randomly generated solutions will be considered as fireflies, and brightness is assigned depending on their performance on the objective function.

Particle Swarm Optimization : Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regards to a given measure of quality.

Support Vector Machine : A support vector machine (SVM) is a type of deep learning algorithm that performs supervised learning for classification or regression of data groups. In AI and machine learning, supervised learning systems provide both input and desired output data, which are labelled for classification.   

Sequential Minimal Optimization :  Sequential minimal optimization (SMO) is an algorithm for solving the quadratic programming (QP) problem that arises during the training of support-vector machines (SVM)

Crow search algorithm : Crow search algorithm (CSA) is a new type of swarm intelligence optimization algorithm proposed by simulating the crows' intelligent behaviour of hiding and retrieving food.
